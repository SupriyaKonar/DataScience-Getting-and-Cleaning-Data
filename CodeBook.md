## Source Data Description

The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data. 

The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain.

## Attribute Information:

For each record in the dataset it is provided: 
- Triaxial acceleration from the accelerometer (total acceleration) and the estimated body acceleration. 
- Triaxial Angular velocity from the gyroscope. 
- A 561-feature vector with time and frequency domain variables. 
- Its activity label. 
- An identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment.

## Code

* Source Files are downloaded, unzipped and features.txt, activity_labels.txt, subject_train.txt, x_train.txt, y_train.txt,subject_test.txt, x_test.txt, y_test.txt files are loaded using read.table.
* Rbind is used to Merge the training and test dataset.
* Features which contains the names for the x_data dataset is applied to the dataset.
* Created a subset of the data by extracting only columns with the mean and standard deviation measures. features.txt is used to provide the column names.
* Facorized Variable activity using descriptive activity names from Activity_Labels.
* Used gsub function to appropriately label the data set with descriptive activity names.
* A second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject is created and output is stored in tidydata.txt file.

## Identifiers

* subject - The ID of the test subject
* activity - The type of activity performed when the corresponding measurements were taken
